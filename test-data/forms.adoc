= Forms and Data Binding

Building forms is a fundamental aspect of web application development. This section covers how to create forms, bind them to data, and validate user input in Vaadin applications.

Forms provide a way for users to input data that your application can process. Whether you're creating a simple contact form or a complex data entry interface, understanding how forms work is crucial.

== Form Basics

Every form consists of several key components:

* **Form layout** - The visual structure and arrangement of form elements
* **Data fields** - Input components like text fields, checkboxes, and dropdowns  
* **Data binding** - Connecting form fields to your data model
* **Validation** - Ensuring the data meets your requirements
* **Submission** - Processing the form data when the user submits

== Common Form Patterns

The following patterns are commonly used when building forms:

=== Simple Data Entry

For basic data entry, you typically have a straightforward form with several fields that map directly to properties of a data object.

=== Master-Detail Forms

More complex scenarios might involve editing an object that has relationships to other objects, requiring master-detail form layouts.

=== Multi-Step Wizards

For complex workflows, you might split your form across multiple steps or pages.
