= Complete Form Example

This example demonstrates a complete form implementation that includes data binding, validation, and proper error handling. The concepts shown here apply to both Flow and Hilla applications.

== The Data Model

First, let's define our data model with validation annotations:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @NotBlank(message = "First name is required")
    @Size(max = 50)
    private String firstName;
    
    @NotBlank(message = "Last name is required") 
    @Size(max = 50)
    private String lastName;
    
    @Email(message = "Please enter a valid email address")
    @NotBlank(message = "Email is required")
    private String email;
    
    @Past(message = "Birth date must be in the past")
    private LocalDate birthDate;
    
    @Pattern(regexp = "\\+?[0-9 ()-]{10,}", message = "Please enter a valid phone number")
    private String phoneNumber;
    
    @NotNull(message = "Please select a customer type")
    private CustomerType customerType;
    
    // Constructors, getters, and setters...
}

public enum CustomerType {
    INDIVIDUAL("Individual"),
    BUSINESS("Business"),
    NON_PROFIT("Non-Profit");
    
    private final String displayName;
    
    CustomerType(String displayName) {
        this.displayName = displayName;
    }
    
    public String getDisplayName() {
        return displayName;
    }
}
----

== Form Layout Structure

Organize your form with logical groupings:

=== Personal Information Section

Group related fields together for better user experience:

* First Name and Last Name
* Email Address  
* Phone Number
* Date of Birth

=== Account Information Section

* Customer Type selection
* Account preferences
* Terms and conditions acceptance

== Validation Strategy

=== Client-Side Validation

Provide immediate feedback for:

* Required field validation
* Format validation (email, phone)
* Length restrictions

=== Server-Side Validation

Always validate on the server for:

* Business rule validation
* Database constraint checks
* Security validation

=== Cross-Field Validation

Some validation rules involve multiple fields:

[source,java]
----
// Example: Business customers must provide a company name
@AssertTrue(message = "Company name is required for business customers")
public boolean isCompanyNameValid() {
    if (customerType == CustomerType.BUSINESS) {
        return companyName != null && !companyName.trim().isEmpty();
    }
    return true;
}
----

== Error Handling Patterns

=== Field-Level Errors

Display errors directly next to the relevant field for immediate context.

=== Form-Level Errors

Show general errors at the top of the form for issues that don't relate to specific fields.

=== Success Feedback

Provide clear confirmation when operations complete successfully:

* Visual indicators (checkmarks, color changes)
* Success messages
* Redirect to confirmation page

== Progressive Enhancement

=== Basic Functionality First

Ensure your form works without JavaScript for maximum accessibility.

=== Add Enhancements

Layer on JavaScript enhancements:

* Real-time validation
* Dynamic field updates
* Autocomplete functionality
* Progressive disclosure

== Performance Considerations

=== Debounce Validation

Avoid validating on every keystroke for expensive operations:

* Use debouncing for server-side validation calls
* Validate locally first, then server-side
* Cache validation results when appropriate

=== Optimize Network Calls

* Batch multiple validation requests
* Use appropriate HTTP caching headers
* Implement request cancellation for outdated requests

== Testing Your Forms

=== Unit Tests

Test individual validation rules and business logic.

=== Integration Tests

Test the complete form submission flow.

=== User Experience Testing

* Test with real users
* Verify accessibility compliance
* Test on different devices and browsers

== Common Pitfalls to Avoid

=== Over-Validation

Don't make the form so strict that it becomes frustrating to use.

=== Inconsistent Validation

Ensure client-side and server-side validation rules match exactly.

=== Poor Error Messages

Avoid technical jargon in user-facing error messages.

=== Accessibility Oversights

Always test with screen readers and keyboard navigation.
